My playground [Antikythera] gear application!

Since [Antikythera] is becoming open-sourced, non-production gear repository can now be publicized too.

It contains [@access-company](https://github.com/access-company)-internal BaaS (Dodai) related codes,
though proprietary components are not tracked in VCS from the beginning, so no problem.
